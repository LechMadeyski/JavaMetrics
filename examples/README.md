# Example data

Here are a couple of example file data formats used by the tool.

## Source code downloading
If you want to download the source code based on the git version control system, you can provide the tool with a CSV containing repositories and commit hashes. You can find an example in file `calculate_metrics.csv`. An input file is traversed for existence of repository and commit_hash columns, from which the corresponding values will be used in the process of acquiring source code.
